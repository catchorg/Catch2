# Open Source projects using Catch2

Catch2 is great for open source. It is licensed under the [Boost Software
License (BSL)](../LICENSE.txt), has no further dependencies and supports
two file distribution.

As a result, Catch2 is used for testing in many different Open Source
projects. This page lists at least some of them, even though it will
obviously never be complete (and does not have the ambition to be
complete). Note that the list below is intended to be in alphabetical
order, to avoid implications of relative importance of the projects.

_Please only add projects here if you are their maintainer, or have the
maintainer's explicit consent._
