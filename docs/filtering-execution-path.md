# How to run specific section/generator

> The generator and generic path filtering was added in Catch2 vX.Y.Z

Catch2 supports picking specific path through a test case by filtering
sections and generator indices to run through. This is done by using one
of the three commandline parameters, one or more times.

```
-c, --section           <section name>
-g, --generator-index   <index in generator>
-p, --path-filter       <path filter spec>
```

All the variants form a shared stack of filters, but if you use only
`-c`/`--section` form to specify section filters, you will get the old
behaviour, which does not affect generators at all. If you also use either
`-g`/`--generator-index`, or `-p`/`--path-filter`, you will get the new
behaviour, which can also filter generator elements.

Both the new and old filter behaviours include some potentially surprising
things:
  * Code outside of sections being skipped will still be executed. E.g.
    any setup code in the TEST_CASE that lives outside of sections.
  * Path filters filter the prefix of the path. So if you specify single
    filter, it affects only the top level sections/generator, with their
    child sections/generators being unfiltered.
  * Path filters are independent of test case selection, Catch2 will try
    to follow the path filters in all selected test cases. This means
    that if you specify path filters without a test case filter, Catch2
    will try to apply the path filters inside every registered test case.

## Old behaviour

> The old behaviour was deprecated in Catch2 vX.Y.Z

```
-c, --section           <section name>
```
The argument to `-c`/`--section` can be any arbitrary string. When Catch2
is deciding whether to enter a section, it will check its trimmed name
against the appropriate trimmed section filter. If they are the same,
the section can be opened. If not, Catch2 will skip over that section.


### Examples

#### Simple section nesting
Given
```cpp
TEST_CASE( "foo" ) {
    REQUIRE( true );
    SECTION( "A" ) {
        SECTION( "A1" ) { REQUIRE( true ); }
        SECTION( "A2" ) { REQUIRE( true ); }
    }
    SECTION( "B" ) {
        SECTION( "B1" ) { REQUIRE( true ); }
        SECTION( "B2" ) { REQUIRE( true ); }
    }
}
```

* `./tests foo -c A` runs section "A" and both of its subsections,
   resulting in 4 assertions.
* `./tests foo -c A -c B` runs section "A", but none of its subsections,
   resulting in 1 assertion (the one before "A").
* `./tests foo -c A -c A1` runs section "A" and only the "A1" subsection,
   resulting in 2 assertions.


#### Sections with nested generators
Note that old behaviour completely _ignores_ generators. This means both
that they can't be filtered, but also that they aren't taken into account
for the filter depth. In other words, given
```cpp
TEST_CASE( "bar" ) {
    REQUIRE( true );
    SECTION( "A" ) { REQUIRE( true ); }
    SECTION( "B" ) {
        auto i = GENERATE( 1, 2, 3 );
        DYNAMIC_SECTION( "i=" << i ) {
            REQUIRE( true );
        }
    }
}
```
* `./tests bar -c A` results in 2 assertions.
* `./tests bar -c B -c i=2` results in 4 assertions, because the whole
  generator in section "B" has to be used up, but the dynamic section is
  only entered when the generator returns 2 as the value for `i`.
* `./tests bar -c B -c i=4` results in 3 assertions, because the assertion
  outside of section is executed every time the test case is entered, and
  the generator forces the test case to rerun 3 times before it is used up,
  even though the dynamic section will never be entered.


#### Section with sibling generators
For cases where sections have sibling generators, the filtering can get
even more surprising.
```cpp
TEST_CASE( "qux" ) {
    REQUIRE( true );
    SECTION( "A" ) { REQUIRE( true ); }
    auto i = GENERATE( 1, 2, 3 );
    DYNAMIC_SECTION( "i=" << i ) {
        REQUIRE( true );
    }
}
```
* `./tests qux -c A` results in **4** assertions, because section "A" is
  entered once, but the sibling generator has to be exhausted, and
  the first assertion is executed once per generator element.
* `./tests qux -c i=2` also results in 4 assertions. Once again,
  the generator has to be exhausted and the dynamic section is entered
  once.


## New behaviour

> The new behaviour was introduced in Catch2 vX.Y.Z

```
-g, --generator-index   <index in generator>
-p, --path-filter       <path filter spec>
```

The argument to `-g`/`--generator-index` must be either a non-negative
number, which is interpreted as the index of the desired element from
the generator, or "\*", which allows all elements from the generator.

Providing index outside of the generator is an error.

The argument to `-p`/`--path-filter` must start with either "c:" for
a section filter, or with "g:" for a generator filter. Everything past
the colon is then parsed as either a section filter, or a generator filter.

Note that using `p`/`--path-filter` enables new filtering behaviour, even
if it is only used to add section filters.

There is another important difference between filtering out sections and
generators. A section can be left un-entered, but a generator always has
to be active. For this reason, if generator fails a filter
(e.g. there is a section filter at given depth instead), it has to stop
the execution of the test case. Currently, this is done via `SKIP()`
equivalent, causing the section to be considered skipped.


### Examples

#### Nested generators
```cpp
TEST_CASE( "waldo" ) {
    auto i = GENERATE( 1, 10, 100 );
    auto j = GENERATE( 2, 20, 200 );
    CAPTURE( i, j );
    REQUIRE( true );
}
```
* `./tests waldo -g 1` results in 3 assertions, with `i := 10`, because
  the second nested generator is unfiltered.
* `./tests waldo -g 1 -g 2` results in 1 assertion, with `i := 10, j := 200`.
* `./tests waldo -g * -g 2` results in 3 assertions, all with `j := 200`.
* `./tests waldo -g 1 -g *` results in 3 assertions, all with `i := 10`.
* `./tests waldo -g 3` results in 1 **failed** assertion, because the first
  generator does not have 3rd element.
* `./tests waldo -g * -g 3` results in 3 **failed** assertions, as the
  second generator does not have 3rd element, but we have to exhaust the
  first generator.

#### Generator with a nested dynamic section
```cpp
TEST_CASE( "grault" ) {
    REQUIRE( true );
    auto i = GENERATE( 1, 2, 3 );
    DYNAMIC_SECTION( "i=" << i ) {
        REQUIRE( true );
    }
}
```
* `./tests grault -p g:1` results in 2 assertions, as there is no filter
  on the dynamic section.
* `./tests grault -p g:1 -p c:i=2` results in 2 assertions, as the filter
  on the dynamic section matches the element given from the generator.
* `./tests grault -p g:1 -p c:i=3` results in 1 assertion, as the generator
  is limited to only try `i := 2` and the dynamic section is filtered out.

#### Section with a sibling generator
Because generators have to stop test execution when they don't pass filter,
it is impossible to run only a section with sibling generator without
triggering a test case skip. Consider this test case from an earlier example:
```cpp
TEST_CASE( "qux" ) {
    REQUIRE( true );
    SECTION( "A" ) { REQUIRE( true ); }
    auto i = GENERATE( 1, 2, 3 );
    DYNAMIC_SECTION( "i=" << i ) {
        REQUIRE( true );
    }
}
```
* `./tests qux -p g:1` results in 2 assertions, as the dynamic section is
  entered only once.
* `./tests qux -p g:1 -p c:i=1` results in 1 assertion, as the dynamic
  section filter is incompatible with the generator filter.
* `./tests qux -p c:A` results in 2 assertions **and a skipped test case**.
  This is because the generator is sibling to section "A", and thus reads
  the same section filter. However, it is not a section and as thus cannot
  proceed.
* `./tests qux -p c:i=2` results in 1 assertion **and a skipped test case**.
  Once again, the first filter in the filter stack is a section filter,
  and thus the generator cannot proceed.

Compare this with the old filter behaviour, where `./tests qux -c i=2`
would instead result in 4 assertions, because the generator would go
through all elements.
