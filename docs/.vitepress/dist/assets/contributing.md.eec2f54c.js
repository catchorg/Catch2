That&#39;s great! Whether it&#39;s a bug fix, a new feature, support for additional compilers - or just a fix to the documentation - all contributions are very welcome and very much appreciated. Of course so are bug reports, other comments, and questions, but generally it is a better idea to ask questions in our <a href="https://discord.gg/4CWS9zD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>, than in the issue tracker.</p><p>This page covers some guidelines and helpful tips for contributing to the codebase itself.</p><h2 id="using-git-hub" tabindex="-1">Using Git(Hub) <a class="header-anchor" href="#using-git-hub" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Ongoing development happens in the <code>devel</code> branch for Catch2 v3, and in <code>v2.x</code> for maintenance updates to the v2 versions.</p><p>Commits should be small and atomic. A commit is atomic when, after it is applied, the codebase, tests and all, still works as expected. Small commits are also preferred, as they make later operations with git history, whether it is bisecting, reverting, or something else, easier.</p><p><em>When submitting a pull request please do not include changes to the amalgamated distribution files. This means do not include them in your git commits!</em></p><p>When addressing review comments in a MR, please do not rebase/squash the commits immediately. Doing so makes it harder to review the new changes, slowing down the process of merging a MR. Instead, when addressing review comments, you should append new commits to the branch and only squash them into other commits when the MR is ready to be merged. We recommend creating new commits with <code>git commit --fixup</code> (or <code>--squash</code>) and then later squashing them with <code>git rebase --autosquash</code> to make things easier.</p><h2 id="testing-your-changes" tabindex="-1">Testing your changes <a class="header-anchor" href="#testing-your-changes" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p><em>Note: Running Catch2&#39;s tests requires Python3</em></p><p>Catch2 has multiple layers of tests that are then run as part of our CI. The most obvious one are the unit tests compiled into the <code>SelfTest</code> binary. These are then used in &quot;Approval tests&quot;, which run (almost) all tests from <code>SelfTest</code> through a specific reporter and then compare the generated output with a known good output (&quot;Baseline&quot;). By default, new tests should be placed here.</p><p>However, not all tests can be written as plain unit tests. For example, checking that Catch2 orders tests randomly when asked to, and that this random ordering is subset-invariant, is better done as an integration test using an external check script. Catch2 integration tests are written using CTest, either as a direct command invocation + pass/fail regex, or by delegating the check to a Python script.</p><p>Catch2 is slowly gaining more and more types of tests, currently Catch2 project also has buildable examples, &quot;ExtraTests&quot;, and CMake config tests. Examples present a small and self-contained snippets of code that use Catch2&#39;s facilities for specific purpose. Currently they are assumed passing if they compile.</p><p>ExtraTests then are expensive tests, that we do not want to run all the time. This can be either because they take a long time to run, or because they take a long time to compile, e.g. because they test compile time configuration and require separate compilation.</p><p>Finally, CMake config tests test that you set Catch2&#39;s compile-time configuration options through CMake, using CMake options of the same name.</p><p>None of these tests are enabled by default. To enable them, add <code>-DCATCH_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON</code>, <code>-DCATCH_BUILD_EXTRA_TESTS=ON</code>, and <code>-DCATCH_ENABLE_CONFIGURE_TESTS=ON</code> when configuration the CMake build.</p><p>Bringing this all together, the steps below should configure, build, and run all tests in the <code>Debug</code> compilation.</p><p><a id="snippet-catch2-build-and-test"></a></p><div class="language-sh line-numbers-mode"><span class="copy"></span><pre><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#676E95;font-style:italic;"># 1.

This means that newly written documentation should be tagged with a placeholder, that will be replaced with the actual version upon release.

Because GitHub markdown does not support automatic generation of ToC, it has to be handled semi-manually. Thus, if you&#39;ve added a new subheading to some page, you should add it to the ToC.

However, having large code snippets inline can make the documentation less readable, and so the inline snippets should be kept reasonably short. To provide more complex compilable examples, consider adding new .cpp file to <code>examples/</code>.</p></li><li><p>Don&#39;t be afraid to introduce new pages. The current documentation tends towards long pages, but a lot of that is caused by legacy, and we know that some of the pages are overly big and unfocused.</p></li><li><p>When adding information to an existing page, please try to keep your formatting, style and changes consistent with the rest of the page.</p></li><li><p>Any documentation has multiple different audiences, that desire different information from the text. The 3 basic user-types to try and cover are:</p><ul><li>A beginner to Catch2, who requires closer guidance for the usage of Catch2.</li><li>Advanced user of Catch2, who want to customize their usage.</li><li>Experts, looking for full reference of Catch2&#39;s capabilities.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="writing-code" tabindex="-1">Writing code <a class="header-anchor" href="#writing-code" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>If want to contribute code, this section contains some simple rules and tips on things like code formatting, code constructions to avoid, and so on.</p><h3 id="c-standard-version" tabindex="-1">C++ standard version <a class="header-anchor" href="#c-standard-version" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Catch2 currently targets C++14 as the minimum supported C++ version. Features from higher language versions should be used only sparingly, when the benefits from using them outweight the maintenance overhead.</p><p>Example of good use of polyfilling features is our use of <code>conjunction</code>, where if available we use <code>std::conjunction</code> and otherwise provide our own implementation. The reason it is good is that the surface area for maintenance is quite small, and <code>std::conjunction</code> can directly use compiler built-ins, thus providing significant compilation benefits.</p><p>Example of bad use of polyfilling features would be to keep around two sets of metaprogramming in the stringification implementation, once using C++14 compliant TMP and once using C++17&#39;s <code>if constexpr</code>. While the C++17 would provide significant compilation speedups, the maintenance cost would be too high.</p><h3 id="formatting" tabindex="-1">Formatting <a class="header-anchor" href="#formatting" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>To make code formatting simpler for the contributors, Catch2 provides its own config for <code>clang-format</code>. However, because it is currently impossible to replicate existing Catch2&#39;s formatting in clang-format, using it to reformat a whole file would cause massive diffs. To keep the size of your diffs reasonable, you should only use clang-format on the newly changed code.</p><h3 id="code-constructs-to-watch-out-for" tabindex="-1">Code constructs to watch out for <a class="header-anchor" href="#code-constructs-to-watch-out-for" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>This section is a (sadly incomplete) listing of various constructs that are problematic and are not always caught by our CI infrastructure.</p><h4 id="naked-exceptions-and-exceptions-related-function" tabindex="-1">Naked exceptions and exceptions-related function <a class="header-anchor" href="#naked-exceptions-and-exceptions-related-function" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>If you are throwing an exception, it should be done via <code>CATCH_ERROR</code> or <code>CATCH_RUNTIME_ERROR</code> in <code>internal/catch_enforce.hpp</code>. These macros will handle the differences between compilation with or without exceptions for you. However, some platforms (IAR) also have problems with exceptions-related functions, such as <code>std::current_exceptions</code>. We do not have IAR in our CI, but luckily there should not be too many reasons to use these. However, if you do, they should be kept behind a <code>CATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE_EXCEPTIONS</code> macro.</p><h4 id="avoid-std-move-and-std-forward" tabindex="-1">Avoid <code>std::move</code> and <code>std::forward</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#avoid-std-move-and-std-forward" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p><code>std::move</code> and <code>std::forward</code> provide nice semantic name for a specific <code>static_cast</code>. However, being function templates they have surprisingly high cost during compilation, and can also have a negative performance impact for low-optimization builds.</p><p>You should be using <code>CATCH_MOVE</code> and <code>CATCH_FORWARD</code> macros from <code>internal/catch_move_and_forward.hpp</code> instead. They expand into the proper <code>static_cast</code>, and avoid the overhead of <code>std::move</code> and <code>std::forward</code>.</p><h4 id="unqualified-usage-of-functions-from-c-s-stdlib" tabindex="-1">Unqualified usage of functions from C&#39;s stdlib <a class="header-anchor" href="#unqualified-usage-of-functions-from-c-s-stdlib" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>If you are using a function from C&#39;s stdlib, please include the header as <code>&lt;cfoo&gt;</code> and call the function qualified.
