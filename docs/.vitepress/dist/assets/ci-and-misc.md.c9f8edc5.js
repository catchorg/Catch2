This page will talk about both.</p><h2 id="continuous-integration-systems" tabindex="-1">Continuous Integration systems <a class="header-anchor" href="#continuous-integration-systems" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Probably the most important aspect to using Catch with a build server is the use of different reporters. Catch comes bundled with three reporters that should cover the majority of build servers out there - although adding more for better integration with some is always a possibility (currently we also offer TeamCity, TAP, Automake and SonarQube reporters).</p><p>Two of these reporters are built in (XML and JUnit) and the third (TeamCity) is included as a separate header. It&#39;s possible that the other two may be split out in the future too - as that would make the core of Catch smaller for those that don&#39;t need them.</p><h3 id="xml-reporter" tabindex="-1">XML Reporter <a class="header-anchor" href="#xml-reporter" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p><code>-r xml</code></p><p>The XML Reporter writes in an XML format that is specific to Catch.</p><p>The advantage of this format is that it corresponds well to the way Catch works (especially the more unusual features, such as nested sections) and is a fully streaming format - that is it writes output as it goes, without having to store up all its results before it can start writing.</p><p>The disadvantage is that, being specific to Catch, no existing build servers understand the format natively. It can be used as input to an XSLT transformation that could convert it to, say, HTML - although this loses the streaming advantage, of course.</p><h3 id="junit-reporter" tabindex="-1">JUnit Reporter <a class="header-anchor" href="#junit-reporter" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p><code>-r junit</code></p><p>The JUnit Reporter writes in an XML format that mimics the JUnit ANT schema.</p><p>The advantage of this format is that the JUnit Ant schema is widely understood by most build servers and so can usually be consumed with no additional work.</p><p>The disadvantage is that this schema was designed to correspond to how JUnit works - and there is a significant mismatch with how Catch works. Additionally the format is not streamable (because opening elements hold counts of failed and passing tests as attributes) - so the whole test run must complete before it can be written.</p><h2 id="other-reporters" tabindex="-1">Other reporters <a class="header-anchor" href="#other-reporters" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Other reporters are not part of the single-header distribution and need to be downloaded and included separately. All reporters are stored in <code>single_include</code> directory in the git repository, and are named <code>catch_reporter_*.hpp</code>. For example, to use the TeamCity reporter you need to download <code>single_include/catch_reporter_teamcity.hpp</code> and include it after Catch itself.</p><div class="language-cpp line-numbers-mode"><span class="copy"></span><pre><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#89DDFF;font-style:italic;">#define</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#82AAFF;">CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN</span></span>
