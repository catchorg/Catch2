 * This is a convenience header for Catch2's Reporter support. It includes
 * **all** of Catch2 headers related to reporters, including all reporters.
 *
 * Generally the Catch2 users should use specific includes they need,
 * but this header can be used instead for ease-of-experimentation, or
 * just plain convenience, at the cost of (significantly) increased
 * compilation times.
 *
 * When a new header (reporter) is added to either the `reporter` folder,
 * or to the corresponding internal subfolder, it should be added here.
