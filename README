CATCH is an automated test framework for C, C++ and Objective-C.

The latest stable version can be found as a single header in the Downloads section.
(The Downloads section is now deprecated on GitHub. Until I move this somewhere else for CATCH it can still be reached here: https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/downloads)

For documentation see the wiki at: https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/wiki

Maintainers: Please now work off the Integration branch and target any pull requests there.
