  /**
   * Controls what is returned when requiring an ES module from a CommonJS file.
   * When using the `esmExternals` option, this will also apply to external
   * modules. By default, this plugin will render those imports as namespace
   * imports i.e.
   *
   * ```js
   * // input
   * const foo = require('foo');
   *
   * // output
   * import * as foo from 'foo';
   * ```
   *
   * However there are some situations where this may not be desired.
   * For these situations, you can change Rollup's behaviour either globally or
   * per module. To change it globally, set the `requireReturnsDefault` option
   * to one of the following values:
   *
   * - `false`: This is the default, requiring an ES module returns its
   *   namespace. This is the only option that will also add a marker
   *   `__esModule: true` to the namespace to support interop patterns in
   *   CommonJS modules that are transpiled ES modules.
   * - `"namespace"`: Like `false`, requiring an ES module returns its
   *   namespace, but the plugin does not add the `__esModule` marker and thus
   *   creates more efficient code. For external dependencies when using
   *   `esmExternals: true`, no additional interop code is generated.
   * - `"auto"`: This is complementary to how `output.exports: "auto"` works in
   *   Rollup: If a module has a default export and no named exports, requiring
   *   that module returns the default export. In all other cases, the namespace
   *   is returned. For external dependencies when using `esmExternals: true`, a
   *   corresponding interop helper is added.
   * - `"preferred"`: If a module has a default export, requiring that module
   *   always returns the default export, no matter whether additional named
   *   exports exist. This is similar to how previous versions of this plugin
   *   worked. Again for external dependencies when using `esmExternals: true`,
   *   an interop helper is added.
   * - `true`: This will always try to return the default export on require
   *   without checking if it actually exists. This can throw at build time if
   *   there is no default export. This is how external dependencies are handled
   *   when `esmExternals` is not used. The advantage over the other options is
   *   that, like `false`, this does not add an interop helper for external
   *   dependencies, keeping the code lean.
   *
   * To change this for individual modules, you can supply a function for
   * `requireReturnsDefault` instead. This function will then be called once for
   * each required ES module or external dependency with the corresponding id
   * and allows you to return different values for different modules.
   * @default false
   */
